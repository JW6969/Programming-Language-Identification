To add a folder source code to the database:
./addToDatabase.sh

Note that you have to edit the shell script if you want to add code from a language that's not already in the shell script.

To add code manually to the database:
python reader.py -l language < myfile

Where language is the language that the file is written in and myfile is the name of the source code file.


To attempt to identify the language of a piece of source code:
python identifylanguage.py < source_code_file

i.e.
python identifylanguage.py < sample.c

You can also type:
python identifylanguage.py -v < source_code_file

This gives you verbose output.


Code intended for Python 2.7.2 on linux.
